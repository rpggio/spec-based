concept Password [U]
purpose
    to securely store and validate user credentials
state
    password: U -> string       # Maps user to hashed password
    salt: U -> string          # Maps user to salt
actions
    set [ user: U ; password: string ] => [ user: U ]
        # Success case: sets password for user

    set [ user: U ; password: string ] => [ error: string ]
        # Error case: password fails validation (min length requirement)

    check [ user: U ; password: string ] => [ valid: boolean ]
        # Returns true if password matches, false otherwise

    check [ user: U ; password: string ] => [ error: string ]
        # Error case: user doesn't exist

    validate [ password: string ] => [ valid: boolean ]
        # Checks password meets requirements without user context
operational principle
    after set [ user: x ; password: "secret123" ] => [ user: x ]
    then check [ user: x ; password: "secret123" ] => [ valid: true ]
    and check [ user: x ; password: "wrong" ] => [ valid: false ]
